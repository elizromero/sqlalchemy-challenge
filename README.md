# sqlalchemy-challenge

This project provides a comprehensive climate analysis for Honolulu, Hawaii, and a Flask API to serve climate-related data. The analysis uses Python, SQLAlchemy, Pandas, and Matplotlib to extract and visualize insights from a SQLite database (hawaii.sqlite). The Flask API serves key insights and supports customizable queries to enhance your holiday planning in Hawaii.
